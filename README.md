Raspberry Pi 4 stock checker ðŸ“ˆ

## Installation
Highly recommend python virtual environment.

* `python3 -m virtualenv [VENV]`
* `source venv/bin/activate`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
I decided to alert myself via a Discord webhook, if you want to do the same, make sure you have a URL for the bot to post to. After that, just run it

`python scraper.py`
